# Lovecroft ðŸ’Œ

Lovecroft is a minimal mailing list manager supporting multiple mailing lists. It backs newsletters behind [thesephist.com](https://thesephist.com) and [Atypical Press](https://atypicalpress.com). Lovecroft acts as a common backend for static sites that need to host email subscriptions, and exposes a cross-origin JSON API for enrolling in and unsubscribing from mailing lists.
